## ECDSA Node

This project is an example of using a client and server to facilitate transfers between different addresses. Since there is just a single server on the back-end handling transfers, this is clearly very centralized. We won't worry about distributed consensus for this project.

However, something that we would like to incoporate is Public Key Cryptography. By using Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures we can make it so the server only allows transfers that have been signed for by the person who owns the associated address.

### My solution

1. Generate accounts on the server side to simulate the user creating accounts.
2. Simulation when the user gets the wallet information from local and then selects the account (switches the private key) before sending the asset.

> Because the wallet is generated by the user, we can ensure that they have ownership of the wallet (private key).
> The user cannot select an account that does not belong to them because they do not have the dependent private key.

3. The user signs the data before sending the asset, and sends the data with the signature to the verifier (The node).
4. The verifier recovers the user's public key from the data sent by the user, and then uses the public key, data and signature to verify that the transaction has not been modified or lost during the sending period.

> `verify()` helps us to take the public key recovered from data and decrypt the signature, then compare it with the hash message to see if it is the same, if it is, it means the transaction is valid.

5. The verifier can send a transaction after confirming that it is a legal transaction sent by the user, otherwise reject the transaction.

### Set up

1. In `initConfig.js` under the `server/script` folder, set the number of accounts you want to simulate.
2. Run `node accountGenerator.js` to create accounts.
3. Copy the result from the console and paste it into the specified location in `index.js`.

### Client

The client folder contains a [react app](https://reactjs.org/) using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open up a terminal in the `/client` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application
4. Now you should be able to visit the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

### Server

The server folder contains a node.js server using [express](https://expressjs.com/). To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal within the `/server` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `node index` to start the server

The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically!

_Hint_ - Use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) instead of `node` to automatically restart the server on any changes.
